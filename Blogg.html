                                dedicated, hardworking and is a perfectionist.
                                Kamini stays back at work late one evening with her colleague Ravi to complete work for

                                    After dinner, Ravi proposes to Kamini that he would like her to spend

                                with a male <span id="dotsB">...</span><span id="moreB"> member of the household.
                                    She finds the male member constantly leering at her when

                                    around the house wrapped in
                                    nothing but a towel which makes her very uncomfortable. On
                                    one occasion, while she was sweeping, he pinched her bottom.
                                    When she protested that she will complain to the lady of the
                                    house, he threatened to accuse her of stealing, and that he will
                                    ensure that she loses her job.

                                In the first few months of Asha’s employment, Dr. Purshottam is very pleased with her

                                said she started noticing disturbing behavior from two of the <span

                                    She said it began with harassing comments and
                                    it quickly turned more serious.

                                    "They would come up behind me … and they would just rub up against me," Madison
                                    said.
